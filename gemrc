# This is the system wide config file for Rubygems.
# It is generated by RubyInstaller as a security measure.
# Feel free to add any rubygems config options as described on:
#    https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.1/Gem/ConfigFile.html
# But do not delete this file as otherwise it could be hijacked by
# another user in a multi-user environment.
# Paste this file in C:\ProgramData\ for Windows OS (Tried and tested on Win7 x64) and 'gem update && gem cleanup' will pick this.
