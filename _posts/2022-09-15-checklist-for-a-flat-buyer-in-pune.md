title: Checklist for a flat buyer in Pune
---

Recently one of my friend was looking to buy a new residential flat in Pune and asked me if there is a checklist.

I immediately replied in the chat to my friend, a "rough" checklist which I am also going to elaborate in this blogpost. 

So here is a checklist that I think a flat buyer can use based on my personal journey and experience of buying a flat in Pune :   
  
  
> ```Note: I feel that until each step in the checklist is not followed strictly, one should not even move to the next step at all.``` 

  1. Finalise budget, BHK type (no. of rooms), and group of localities you like before even you start your flat buying journey. These 3 things should be damn final and you should be firm on them.

  2. For each flat, consider builder's experience (and not reputation as depicted in media) : Check past delivered projects by asking residents of those delivered projects or confirming the same as a recommendation in your network.   
  
  3. For each site visit, run away from project site if sample flat is furnished one OR the sample flat is at separate location from the building wing where all the residents are going to reside. Dont fall for the trap of visiting the sample flat even if requested multiple times by the builder.

4. Remember, less amenities = less maintenance preferred. On flat visit, make sure you note flat layout, carpet space, facing, frontage, ventillation and rooms layout. Do not forget to confirm electricity and drainage connections of the project site.

5. For each of 3 final selected flats, RERA project details with litigations : Easily doable online as a self-lookup. 

6. For final one flat that you selected, paid lawyer due deligence is a must : Property advocate will confirm land litigations, many other certificates and other details. 

7. At agreement time, read carefully line by line the draft soft copy of flat sale agreement and the final agreement. 

8. At possession time, basically check everything in your flat : Kitchen top leakage, all dado works, all tiles grooving and cleaned plumbing system. 

	Best of Luck !
