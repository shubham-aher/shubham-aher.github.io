title: How many blog engines ?
---

If you have read my earlier [blogpost of completing 10 years since my first blog](/10-years-since-my-first-blog), then you must already know by now that I have used 3 blog engines till now : 

| Syntax | Description | URL |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 2012-2015 | Google Blogger | shubhamaher.blogspot.com |
| 2016-2018 | Github Pages with Jekyll | shubhamaher.github.io |
| 2019-2021 | Wordpress with custom domain and hosting | shub.am |
| 2022 | Github Pages with Jekyll | shubhamaher.com |



## 2012-2015 Blogger : 
### Pros: 
Easy to format, many features to upload pictures, change preferences, etc. 
### Cons: 
Needs many HTML/CSS/JS tricks to customize, lots of hacks needed, limited tweaks, less control over data ownership, compliances, etc. 

---

## 2016-2018 Github Pages with Jekyll : 
### Pros: 
Markdown posts are easy but initial markdown syntax learning curve, simple design and themes, etc. 
### Cons: 
Too much debugging needed if not done correctly or need to dig more to tweak, less visual features, etc. 

---

## 2019-2021 Wordpress : 
### Pros: 
Simple visual features, easy to use, etc. 
### Cons: 
Need to manage yearly hosting stuff, needs self-management which is tedious and expensive for long term purpose of my need, etc. 

---

## 2022 Github Pages with Jekyll : 
### Pros: 
Less distractions while writing, more focused on content then other tweaks, static sites so faster loadtimes, etc. 
### ~~Cons~~ Conclusion ! : 
Lets see how long I can use this blog engine then I can summarise. For now, its easy write content and export it to a static site in a quick way.

See you soon !
