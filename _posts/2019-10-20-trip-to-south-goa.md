This year, in the monsoon season, knowing that the rainfall is incessant and will last longer than previous year I thought September last week will be the best time for the “annual” Goa trip. Yes!, you read it right “annual” because Goa is something I visit almost every year to unwind.

Add to it the fact that the end of the monsoon season is around the month of September and the start of tourist season is around mid-October (because of Diwali vacations, Christmas, New Year, etc).

So travelling to Goa at the end of the month of September was my best decision to enjoy the less-crowded beaches, awesome greenery-just-after-the-end-of-monsoon season, benefits of less prices before the start of the tourist season: in short to Enjoy the Best of Goa !

Since this was my 7th trip to Goa and in all my previous travels, I have stayed at and visited places of North Goa, this time I decided to stay at South Goa.

Looking for accomodation in the South Goa, I found a very good deal on Goibibo for Treehouse Nova, Cansaulim at just 5195 INR for 3 nights with breakfasts !

## Itinerary

Although I have visited Goa in the past, it was the first Goa trip for my wife and so I came up with the below itinerary to consider places of South Goa keeping in mind the places of North and Central Goa as well.

Day 	Region 	Places
1 	South Goa 	Mobor beach, Colva beach
2 	North Goa 	Calangute beach, Anjuna beach
3 	Central Goa 	Panjim city, Miramar beach
4 	South Goa 	Arossim beach, Majorda beach, Nanu beach

## Beach Hopping !

### Mobor Beach (Day 1)

One of my favourite lunch : Goan Fish Thali at Betty’s Place near Mobor Beach

### Calangute Beach (Day 2)
Relaxing on the Calangute Beach

At Calangute Beach, we just relaxed at a shack gazing at the sea and sipping drinks 😉

> Travel Tip#1: Water sports are expensive and limited at Calangute Beach so prefer to do them at less price on Anjuna Beach which is not that far from Calangute Beach.

### Anjuna Beach (Day 2)

We did water sports at Anjuna Beach.

> Travel Tip#2: Now a days, water sports activities have been commercialised a lot and hence the prices are now increased. However if more than one person is going to do the water sports, be patient and bargain !

I struck a good deal for 2 of us that included a package of 4 sports ( Parasailing, Banana ride, Bumper ride and Jetski ride) for 2200 INR (2people).
Getting ready for Parasailing !

In Panaji, we visited the Fontainhas (Latin Quarter), Panaji Church, Viva Panjim and Miramar Beach.
