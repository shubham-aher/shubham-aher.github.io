I feel there is no such thing as "success" instead it is "personal success".

Very often people don't treat "success" as "personal success". By this I mean they compare their own success to others. 

Each person runs their own race of life. He has his own value system. 

Success has varied number of factors and whatever impact these factors is going to have on the success of a person is going to be limited to the person in question. 

Also different people may have different priorities, factors and timelines that contribute to their success. They may have different goals, choices, appetite and satisfaction levels. 

That is why I feel, "success" is actually "personal success". 

When one treats it as "personal success",
	
1.	He is aware of the terms and conditions that come with it. 
2.	He does not treat the role model, if any, as the sole destination but instead gains knowledge about the big picture of risks and rewards from the experience of the role model. 
3.	He is aware of the "what, why, when, where and how" questions about his idea of the quest of success. 

Now it seems, someone has aptly said that "personal finance" is "personal". :-)

So the next time you read the word "success" just replace it with "personal success" in your mind.
