### The Beginning...
Since childhood I have been fascinated by people like magicians, jugglers, gymnasts, etc.

I was 10 when, I autodidactically learnt to juggle 3 rubber cricket balls. 

At that time I didn't even knew that this activity is called as '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling" target="_blank">juggling</a>' and I abandoned it very early. 

Seven years later while browsing the Internet I came to know that it is called as 'juggling' and many people practise it. 

Soon I discovered a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/eMretsiM/videos" target="_blank">bunch of videos on Youtube</a> that taught different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling_pattern" target="_blank">juggling tricks</a> and I became very obsessed with it. 

Since then I have been juggling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling_ball" target="_blank">balls (or more specifically beanbags)</a> and have moved on steadily to juggle various other props like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling_ring" target="_blank">rings</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling_club" target="_blank">clubs</a>. 

Below you will find various props I juggle, videos I have learnt from and jugglers who motivate me.
